      <h2>The Turbulent Life of Vincent van Gogh</h2>
      <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853â€“1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who became one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.</p>
      
      <p>His early life was marked by various unsuccessful ventures, including working as an art dealer and a missionary. It was not until his late twenties that he fully committed to art, driven by a deep sense of purpose and a desire to connect with humanity through his paintings.</p>
      
      <h3>Early Career and Influences</h3>
      <p>Initially, Van Gogh's palette was dominated by dark, earthy tones, reflecting the somber reality of peasant life he observed in the Netherlands. His masterpiece from this period, "The Potato Eaters," exemplifies this early, more realistic style.</p>
      
      
      <section id="artwork">
        <h3>Iconic Masterpieces</h3>
        <p>Van Gogh's work includes self-portraits, landscapes, still lifes, portraits and paintings of cypress trees, wheat fields, and sunflowers. His works often feature bold color, dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.</p>
        
        <p>Some of his most famous paintings are <em>The Starry Night</em>, <em>Sunflowers</em>, and <em>Cafe Terrace at Night</em>. These works showcase his revolutionary use of color and light, often depicting scenes from his surroundings with unparalleled emotion.</p>

        <h3>Post-Impressionism and Unique Style</h3>
        <p>Though his primary influence was Impressionism, Van Gogh developed a highly personal and expressive style, characterized by thick, swirling brushstrokes (impasto) and intense, often contrasting colors. This style profoundly impacted Expressionism and other movements of the early 20th century. His emotional intensity and vibrant palette were revolutionary for his time.</p>
